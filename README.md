  ## Introduction

This project aims to gain insights into customer behavior and optimize sales strategies for an online retail business. We will perform data analysis, develop predictive models, and visualize the results.

## Data Overview

The project uses the [Online Retail Dataset] containing sales and customer data. The dataset includes information such as customer ID, purchase history, and product details.


## Data Preprocessing

- Data cleaning: Removed duplicates and missing values.
- Feature engineering: Created new features like customer segmentation.
- Data transformation: Scaled and encoded variables for modeling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We explored customer purchasing patterns, identified top-selling products, and visualized trends in sales over time. 
1) The retail store is interested in viewing the Time series of the revenue data for the year 2011.
2) Interested in viewing the top 10 countries that are generating the highest revenue?
3) Top 10 countries that are generating the high revenue without the United Kingdom in this visual
4) To view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue
5) To view information on the bottom 10 customer by revenue
6) To view the Top 10 Customers Buy a top Products

# Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning

we build  a machine-learning model for customer segmentation. Customer segmentation is a vital task for businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and services to specific customer groups.

## Machine Learning Model

- Algorithm: We employed a K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers.
- Hyperparameters: We used k=5 clusters for this model.
- Model Training: The model was trained using the Scikit-Learn library in Python.
